# Your Blog:
YourBlog is a small side project I've started. It's a site designed so that people can sign up, create journalism/blog articles and then share them with the public for free.

Deployed: **coming soon**


## Purpose:
The aim of the site is to give up and coming jouranlist a platform to display their work for free. The aim is to give jouranlists a platform to create a portfolio, that they'd later be able to show to employees.

A stretch goal would be a functional site where Journalists feel comfortable to share their work and then link our site on their social media pages. Then incorporate a way for them to earn ad revenue off their posts.

## Functionality: 
YourBlog is currently in development, but the goal is to have a site where users can create their profile, then treat it like their own Portfolio. 

A user that has an account will be able to Log In, view their previous posts and create new posts for them to be able to share. Users that have an account will also be able to like and comment on others posts.

A user that does not have an account will be able to directly go to a jouranlists URL and view their posts, or directly to a linked post. 

# Project Planning

## Minimum Viable Product

The Minimum Viable Product to be produced is a site, where users can sign up, create their profile, then post their content and link their URL to employers. 

The next step after this would be a way for users to subscribe to other jouranlists and have a 'Newsfeed' where they can view posts by their favourite journalists.
